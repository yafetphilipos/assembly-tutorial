# Commands to run in Linux environment  
Assembly program to run 
## install package 
```
sudo apt-get install nasm gcc
```

## To run a program titled assembly.asm
```
nasm -f elf64 assembly.asm 
ld -s -o assembly assembly.o 
./assembly 
```

## all in one code 
```
nasm -f elf64 assembly.asm && ld -s -o assembly assembly.o  && ./assembly 
```

# Code explanation

```
nasm -f elf64 assembly.asm
```

* `nasm`: This is the command to invoke the Netwide Assembler.
* `-f elf64`: This flag specifies the output format of the assembled code. In this case, elf64 indicates that the output will be a 64-bit ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) object file, which is suitable for 64-bit Linux systems.
* `assembly.asm`: This is the input file containing the assembly language source code that you want to assemble.


```
ld -s -o assembly assembly.o 
```
* `ld`: This command invokes the linker, which combines one or more object files into an executable.
* `-s`: This option tells the linker to strip all symbol information from the output file, making it smaller and potentially faster to load.
* `-o assembly`: This specifies the name of the output executable file. In this case, it will be named assembly.
* `assembly.o`: This is the object file generated by NASM in the previous step. The linker takes this file and produces an executable.


## To remove files beside the code 

```
rm assembly *.o
```
